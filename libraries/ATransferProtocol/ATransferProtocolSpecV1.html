<h1>A Transfer Protocol (ATP)</h1>
Design Specification Document<br>
<a href="http://votsh.com/bio-for-frank-cohen/">Frank Cohen</a>, fcohen@votsh.com<br>
Early Draft, March 8, 2014<br>
<h2>Goal</h2>
Easy and efficient file transfer between microcontrollers over a mesh or point-to-point radio network.<br>
<h2>Concept</h2>
The <a href="http://votsh.com">Votsh Waves</a> project distributes audio and light show information
from a server through a lead-peer microcontroller to peer
microcontrollers. The peers use Atmel 802.15.4 radios in the
ATmega256RFR2 chip to form a mesh network, or XBee radios.<br>
<br>

A special kind of transfer protocol is needed to make best use of the
unique characteristics of the mesh network and stack. For example, the
mesh network enables automatic routing and forwarding of data
through peers. If the Lead Peer sends data to Peer 1 the best route
could be through Peer 2.<br>

<br>
ATP uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology">long-polling push</a> approach to initiate a transfer. For example, the lead peer says
to peer 1, "Hey peer 1, I want to transfer data to you. Here is the
reference to it, and the size of it, and a chunk size appropriate to
this type of data and network". The lead peer then goes back to doing
whatever else it wants.<br>
<br>
Peer 1 sends a pull request to the lead peer, "Hey lead peer, please give me
chunk #1 of the data". Peer 1 sends an additional request for chunks 2,
3, and 4 to the lead peer concurrently. Peer 1 then receives a chunk
and saves the chunk to the right place in a buffer or in a file in a
SDRAM card.<br>
<br>
Peer 1 keeps track of each chunk. It puts the priority on the lower
chunk numbers. If peer 1 receives higher chunk numbers first, it sends
a retry request for the lower chunks.<br>
<br>
The stack on peer 1 provides an API for apps running on peer 1 to use
the received chunks and optionally wait for all the chunks to be
received.<br>
<br>
Peer 1 uses checksum values to certify each chunk was correctly received and stored.<br>
<h2>What ATP Is Not</h2>
ATP is for point-to-point transfer over a mesh network from one peer to another peer. ATP is not a
distributed hashmap system where the same data appears on multiple peers. For that we recommend you look at <a href="http://telehash.org">telehash</a>.
Telehash sends and receives small encrypted bits of JSON (with optional
binary payloads) via UDP using an efficient routing system based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a>, a proven and popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">Distributed Hash Table</a>. Read the <a href="https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/protocol.md">telehash specification</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ATP is a streaming protocol. Apps can get started using transferred data while the transfer is in progress.</li>
  <li>ATP runs on top of multiple types of network stack, including <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/lightweight_mesh.aspx">LWM</a> and <a href="http://telehash.org">telehash</a>. ATP does not require the stack to provide reliability, out-of-order transmission, packet or stream based APIs.<br>
  </li>

  <li>ATP protocol does not need a callback mechanism to signal
successful transfer of chunks. The receiving peer is responsible for requesting
and receiving chunks, including retries.</li>
  <li>The peer identifies data encoding, compression, and security techniques.</li>
  <li>The peer dynamically changes chunk size, data encoding,
compression, and security techniques in response to actual transfer
speeds and efficiency.</li>
  <li>ATP is compatible with 802.15.4 mesh network, Wifi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet networks, including TCP and UDP protocols.</li>
  <li>ATP provides mini-memory allocation for the transferred data, including expiration.</li>
  <li>ATP can transfer data sets up to 4 Gigibytes long, in chunks from 1 to 65K bytes long</li>
  <li>Values optimized for small memory footprint<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Lead hash begins the ATP protocol by making a Transfer Request. Peer 1
responds with Chunk Transfer requests. Peer 1 signals a completion
status when all chucks are received.<br>

<h3>Transfer Request</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AUID - A Unique ID, 16 bit value, hash of the request type
(first 2 bits set at 0,0), PAN ID, current time in milliseconds, and
count of TransferRequest objects created. While a hash introduces the
possibility of collissions, AUID is a hash for situations where a peer
crashed or went offline temporarily during a transfer session.<br>
</li>
  <li>Version - 8 bit value, version of the request schema</li>
  <li>Size - 32 bit unsigned value, number of 8 bit unsigned bytes to transfer</li>

  <li>Time - 32 bit unsigned value, milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT<br>
  </li>
  <li>Expires - 16 bit unsigned value number of milliseconds after Time value  </li>
  
  <li>Descriptor - 5 character array of abbreviated MIME types, see <a href="http://www.abbreviations.com/acronyms/MIMETYPES">http://www.abbreviations.com/acronyms/MIMETYPES</a><br>
</li>
  <li>Source - serving resource (Mesh, Point, URL), if mesh then the Source is the PAN value, used only by the receiving peer<br>
</li>
  <li>Destination - consuming resource (Mesh, Point, URL), if
mesh then the Destination is the PAN value, used only by the sending
peer<br>
</li>
  <li>FileName - 16 character file name with null terminator, or null if store to memory buffer<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Chunk Request</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AUID - 16 bit value, a unique identifier from Transfer Request, with the first 2 bits set at 0,1, identifying the request type<br>
</li>
  <li>Start byte offset - 32 bit unsigned value, starting address of transfer</li>
  <li>Length - 16 bit unsigned value, quantity of 8 bit unsigned values to transfer, if compression is used the length is the quantity of values after compression</li>
  <li>Transfer types - Four 2-bit values packed into 1 8-bit unsigned value:<br>
PCT - Preferred compression technique - compression: 0 = none, 1 = RTE, 2 = Lempel<br>
PET - Preferred encryption technique - 0 = none, 1 = encryption engine 1, 2 engine 2, etc.<br>
PVT - Preferred verify technique - 0 = 8 bit checksum<br>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Chunk Response<br>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>AUID - 16 bit value, a unique identifier from Transfer Request, , with the first 2 bits set at 1,0 identifying the response type</li><li>Status - Success, Failed during transit, failed checksum</li>
  <li>Start byte offset - 32 bit unsigned value, starting address of transfer</li>

if compression is used the length is the quantity of values after
compression<br>
